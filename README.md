*DESCRIPTION*: The primary objective of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is a crucial aspect of NLP that involves determining the emotional tone or attitude conveyed by a piece of text. This task requires the application of NLP techniques to analyze textual data, such as tweets or reviews, and classify the sentiment expressed in the text as positive, negative, or neutral.

The deliverable for this task is a Jupyter Notebook that showcases the entire process of sentiment analysis, from data preprocessing to model implementation and insights. The notebook should be well-organized, with clear headings and sections, and should include a brief summary of the findings and implications.

To complete this task, you will need to perform the following steps:

Firstly, you will need to collect a dataset of textual data, such as tweets or reviews. The dataset should be relevant to the sentiment analysis task and should contain a sufficient number of samples. You can use publicly available datasets or collect your own data using APIs or web scraping techniques.

Once you have collected the dataset, you will need to preprocess the text data to prepare it for sentiment analysis. This involves cleaning the text data by removing special characters, punctuation, and digits, and then tokenizing the text into individual words or tokens. You will also need to remove stopwords, which are common words like "the," "and," and "a" that do not add much value to the sentiment analysis.

After preprocessing the text data, you will need to select a suitable NLP technique for sentiment analysis. Some popular techniques include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). You will need to train the selected model on the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Finally, you will need to interpret the results of the sentiment analysis and provide insights into the findings. This involves visualizing the results using plots and charts to illustrate the distribution of sentiments, such as positive, negative, and neutral. You should also provide a summary of the findings, including the overall sentiment of the dataset and any notable trends or patterns.

In addition to the above requirements, you should also ensure that your code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices for coding. You should provide clear and concise documentation for the code, including comments and docstrings. Finally, you should interpret the results of the sentiment analysis in the context of the problem or application.

Your submission will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Technical soundness: accuracy and effectiveness of the sentiment analysis model
- Code quality: readability, structure, and adherence to best practices
- Insights and visualization: clarity and effectiveness of the results interpretation and visualization
- Documentation: quality and completeness of the code documentation

To submit your assignment, please upload a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) containing the code, results, and insights. Ensure that the notebook is well-organized, with clear headings and sections, and includes a brief summary of the findings and implications.
